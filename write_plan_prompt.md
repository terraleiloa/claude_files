Great. I need your help to write out a comprehensive  implementation plan.

Assume that the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. document everything they need to know. which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check. how to test it.give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. frequent commits.
                                                
Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. assume they don't know good test design very well.  

please write out this plan, in full detail including updating readme files, into docs/plans/ and create github tickets for each step in the current repo.
